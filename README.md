# Python scripts
This contains most public pythons files I have.
As a warning 'malicious example.py' is a malicious example that puts you into fullscreen (provided you are running windows), creates and runs a copy of itself,
and then also puts that in fullscreen. 'fullscreen.overrideredirect(True)' means that there is no way to close it except task manager, making it more dangerous.
Nothing malicious is done, but in files like that there is a possibility.
